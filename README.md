**📚 BookTrack Library Management System**
 
**📌 Description / Overview**
BookTrack is a Java-based console application designed to simulate a full library management system. 
It provides core library functions such as adding users, adding books, searching, borrowing, returning, and reserving. 
The system tracks user borrowing limits, manages book availability, and automatically assigns reserved books to the next user in the queue once returned.

This project demonstrates structured Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java using inheritance, polymorphism, and custom exception handling. 
It also solves typical library workflow challenges—such as preventing over-borrowing, identifying valid borrowers, managing reservation queues, 
and keeping records organised—making it suitable for academic submissions or small-scale library simulations.
